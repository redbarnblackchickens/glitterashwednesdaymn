            <h2>‘We are children of Earth,
                yes, and of Starry Heaven’
            </h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Children of Earth and Starry Heaven.</p>
                <p>Whatever our theology, that is true. Simple, clear, and true. We are of Earth. And we are of black
                    holes
                    and
                    supernovae and red dwarfs and yellow stars (especially our own star, Sol). We are (as is Earth
                    herself,
                    come
                    down to it) the children of hydrogen exploding, of molecules coming into being, of all that the
                    universe
                    contains. The interconnected, interdependent web of existence is not only Earthly, but universal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Remember you are a child of Earth and Starry Heaven.” So it is not only ashes that remind us who we
                    are
                    and
                    who
                    we need to be…it is also glitter, a sweet, postmodern reminder of the stars.
                </p>

            <p>We gather as believers in the life and resurrection of Jesus to share in a Christian practice of
                repentance and redemption.
            </p>
            <p><strong>We gather as faithful witnesses.</strong></p>
            <p>We gather as witnesses to the Divine possibility that is reflected in each and every human being.</p>

            <p><strong>We join in solidarity.</strong></p>

            <p>
                We join in solidarity with those harmed by proclamation of a false and deadly “gospel,” especially all
                queer and trans souls, those who have survived, and those who have not.

            </p>
            <p> <strong>We repent of our sins and our shortcomings.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>We grieve our failure to witness to the power of God’s justice, liberation, and love.</p>

            <p><strong>We determine to do better.</strong></p>

            <p>Through our actions and our words, we will bring to life the Creator’s expansive vision of justice
                for all people.

            <p><cite>Please join us by reading the parts in bold together.</cite></p>


            <p>As we move into this season of Lent, we confess our sins and we name the spaces where repentance and
                renewal are still needed:
            </p>
            <p>Most holy and merciful God: <strong>we confess to you and to one another, and before the whole company of
                    heaven, that we have sinned by our fault, by our own fault, by our own most grievous fault, in
                    thought, word, and deed, by what we have done and by what we have left undone.
                </strong></p>

            <p>We have not loved you with our whole heart, and mind, and strength. We have not loved our neighbors as
                ourselves. We have failed to see your Divine Spark in our lives and in the lives of others. We have not
                forgiven others as we have been forgiven.</p>

            <p><strong>Have mercy on us, O God.
                </strong></p>

            <p>
                We have shut our ears to your call to serve as Christ served us. We have neglected and criminalized the
                poor and those experiencing homelessness. We have not been true to the mind of Christ. We have grieved
                your Holy Spirit.
            </p>
            <p> <strong>Have mercy on us, O God.
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>Our past unfaithfulness, the pride, envy, hypocrisy, and apathy that have infected our lives, we confess
                to you.</p>
            <p> <strong>Have mercy on us, O God.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>Our self-indulgent appetites and ways, and our exploitation of other people, especially the Wahpekute
                Dakota on whose ancestral lands we now stand, we confess to you. </p>

            <p> <strong>Have mercy on us, O God.
                </strong>
            </p>



            <p>Our neglect of human need and suffering, our contributions to oppression, and our indifference to
                injustice and cruelty, we confess to you.
            </p>
            <p> <strong>Have mercy on us, O God.
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>Our false judgments, our uncharitable thoughts toward our neighbors, and our prejudice and contempt
                toward those who differ from us, we confess to you. </p>
            <p> <strong>Have mercy on us, O God.
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>Our waste and pollution of your creation, and our lack of concern for those who come after us, we confess
                to you.


            </p>
            <p> <strong>Have mercy on us, O God.
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>We repent because we have been brought up in a broken world that has taught us to prioritize power and
                isolation over communal action and care for one another. The habits of oppression, of violence often
                come more easily than the practices of sharing resources and challenging bigotry. </p>

            <p> <strong>Have mercy on us, O God.
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>Restore us, O God, and remind us of your never-failing love.
            </p>

            <p> <strong>Hear us, O God, for your mercy is great.
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>Please help us claim for each other, for ourselves, for our siblings, your deep and abiding forgiveness.
                Remind us that your bold, expansive, queer love shines on all of us and through each of us. Fill us with
                your Divine Spark and help us to see the sparkle in others.</p>


            <p>All who would be marked with the Ashes of humility and the Glitter of life, come now.

            <h2>Ash Wednesday: Blessing the Dust</h2>
            <p><cite>Poem by Jan Richardson</cite></p>

            <p>This is the moment<br>
                we ask for the blessing<br>
                that lives within<br>
                the ancient ashes,<br>
                that makes its home<br>
                inside the soil of<br>
                this sacred earth.<br><br>

                So let us be marked<br>
                not for sorrow.<br>
                And let us be marked<br>
                not for shame.<br>
                Let us be marked<br>
                not for false humility<br>
                or for thinking<br>
                we are less<br>
                than we are<br><br>

                but for claiming<br>
                what God can do<br>
                within the dust,<br>
                within the dirt,<br>
                within the stuff<br>
                of which the world<br>
                is made<br>
                and the stars that blaze<br>
                in our bones<br>
                and the galaxies that spiral<br>
                inside the smudge<br>
                we bear.

            <h2>About Glitter Ash Wednesday</h2>
            <p> Glitter+Ash Wednesday promotes the visibility of progressive, queer-positive Christians and the God we
                worship.

            </p>


            <p>Ash Wednesday is the day in the Christian calendar that marks the beginning of the season of Lent&mdash;a
                season marked by fasting, repentance, and transformation. On this day, people often have their foreheads
                marked with ashes to signify an acknowledgment of suffering and death, repentance for our role in the
                violence that pervades our world, and a longing to be transformed.

            </p>

            <p>By being marked with glitter instead of ashes, we are joining thousands of people in public witness
                across the U.S., the U.K., and Canada. While ashes are a sign of death, glitter is a sign of hope.
                Glitter ashes signify the inclusion of LGBTQIA+ people who are too often rejected by the church.
            </p>

            <p>Glitter ashes also signify our promise to repent, to show up, to bear witness, and to work for a better
                world. They are a powerful reminder of St. Augustine’s teaching that we cannot despair, because despair
                paralyzes.
            </p>

            <p>Glitter+Ash Wednesday imagines a world of transformation, courage, and resistance and invites us all to
                bear the mark of inclusion and hope.
            </p>
